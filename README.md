## The only way to prep for the Cell Games (or Software Interviews)

For my own sanity, and to better structure my preperation for Software Engineering
interviews, I have decided to create this repo which will be a means of keeping track
of useful resources that I find, as well coding up solutions for some practice problems.

## Structure

I always find that it helps to put some structure and sense to practice. For my that
purpose, I find that [HiredInTech](http://www.hiredintech.com/app) is an invaluable
resource, and one I will be following myself. Not only that, but it also has some
problems and links to material to help learn the theory and then put it to practice.

## Resources

- [CTCI](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850)
  - Pretty much the go-to, the classic, tried and true.
- [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202)
  - A great tool to learn classic algorithms and algorithmic thinking,
  IMO better than CLRS (but less in depth)

## Practice

- [Leetcode](http://www.leetcode.com)
  - A great set of problems with an online judge and difficulty rating
- [HackerRank](http://www.hackerrank.com)
  - Another great tool for practicing problems online
- [Topcoder](https://arena.topcoder.com/)
  - Problems meant for programming competitions, but great for prep as well
